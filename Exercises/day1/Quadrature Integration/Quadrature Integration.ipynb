It turns out that there are much more efficient ways to solve it though. \n","\n","You are probably familiar with approximating integrals by dividing the intervale $[a,b]$ into $N$ different equally spaces sub-intervals with width $h=(b-a)/N$, and using the Trapezoid rule. \n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\int_{x_1}^{x_N} f(x) dx  \\approx h \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \\ldots + f(x_{N-1}) + \\frac{1}{2} f(x_N) \\right] + \\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","If we use fewer points, then this integral will be computed faster, but our error goes as $N^{-2}$ so the more points we use, the better. If we know that we want some level of fractional precision, $\\epsilon$, then one way to compute this is to start by assuming a single interval, and computing $I_1 = (b-a) \\times \\frac{1}{2} [f_b + f_a]$, then if the specified precision hasn't been met, sub-divide each sub-interval $[a,b]$ into two  again, computing $I_{N=2}$, checking the precision, which if not satisfied can prompt our program to sub-divide again.
